# 100daysofML

my version of 100 days of code by writing code to support my ML learning journey

## Day 1 - The Quick Python Book
read through the quick Python book by Naomi Ceder as a starting point since I am chosing Python as my language of choice for this exercise. It's a fairly short book, pretty good at going over basics of the python langugage and its key concepts. notes from the book and a code exercise from the end of the book in the Day 001 folder.
